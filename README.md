### üõ†Ô∏è Development Note

If you want to add a feature to the project and need to install new packages, follow these steps:

#### ‚ûï Add Dependencies with `uv`

Use `uv pip install` instead of regular `pip install`. This ensures that packages are installed in a reproducible and isolated environment managed by `uv`.

```bash
uv pip install <package-name>
```

For example :

```
uv pip install httpx
```

This automatically updates your virtual environment and makes the package available in the project.



#### üì¶ Update requirements.txt

After installing or upgrading packages, freeze the current environment into requirements.txt

```
uv pip freeze > requirements.txt
```


### ENV File Parameters
This file contains configuration values used by the application.
It's typically used to separate environment-specific settings from the application code.

**filename : app/.env**

```

DATABASE_URI="sqlite:///./app/db/db.sqlite3"
JWT_ISSUER_SERVER="localhost:8000"
