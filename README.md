## Project Architecture

Each module (user, product, etc.) follows Clean Architecture principles:

- `models.py`: Domain entities (database models)
- `schemas.py`: API schemas (Pydantic)
- `repository.py`: Data access layer
- `repository_interface.py`: Abstraction for repository
- `usecases/`: Business/application logic (core use cases)
- `routers.py`: API endpoints

### 🛠️ Development Note

If you want to add a feature to the project and need to install new packages, follow these steps:

#### ➕ Add Dependencies with `uv`

Use `uv pip install` instead of regular `pip install`. This ensures that packages are installed in a reproducible and isolated environment managed by `uv`.

```bash
uv pip install <package-name>
```

For example :

```
uv pip install httpx
```

This automatically updates your virtual environment and makes the package available in the project.


#### ➕ Install pre-commit

```
pre-commit install
```

check all files before commit
```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

#### 📦 Update requirements.txt

After installing or upgrading packages, freeze the current environment into requirements.txt

```
uv pip freeze > requirements.txt
```


### ENV File Parameters
This file contains configuration values used by the application.
It's typically used to separate environment-specific settings from the application code.

**filename : app/.env**

```
ENVIRONMENT='development' # environment variable permitted: 'development', 'production', 'test'
DATABASE_URI="sqlite:///./app/db/db.sqlite3"
JWT_ISSUER_SERVER="localhost:8000"
JWT_SECRET_KEY="your_secure_key"
```
